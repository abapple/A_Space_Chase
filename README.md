## A_SPACE_CHASE 

This is a simple Java program that is the base structure for generating automatic logs for the EscapDeath: A Space Chase interactive website-based learning game. It will generate overall logs "every hour" for the fictional times set, setting Access Logs and then generating corresponding detailed logs for that location on the ship on which the game takes place. The statements for location logs are generated based on the crew member with the exception of the special cases that correspond to both game lore and puzzle pieces. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
